# Frigate is a tool for automatically generating documentation for Helm charts.
# We use it to generate the README.md files in the Chart repos from a .frigate
# jinja template file. The jinja template make use of values.yaml and Chart.yaml
# content, so we monitor for changes to those as well as the generated output.
